/* 
You are going to create a new express server and return data from it
The server should be listening on port 1111

The server has 3 endpoints:
1. / - This should return the html "<h2>Hello World. Welcome to my app</h2>"
2. /recipes/ - returns a JSON array of recipes from the recipes.js file
3. /recipes/:id - returns a single recipe from the recipes.js file

If /recipes/:id is called and the id does not exist, return a 404 status code
